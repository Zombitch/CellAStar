 // - map is a Map object it contains all data that the algorithm will use to determine if each point is available for the path destination.
 // - destinationX and destinationY is the location in the map the player has to go.
 // - forbidenArea is an array of some values that you decide the player cannot go in (the algorithm will consider these value as forbidden and will make a path avoiding those points)
